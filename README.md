We will be using Miniconda/Anaconda to manage our python environment, though you can use whatever method you prefer with the environment.yml file.
The environment.yml file will contain all the packages and their versions in the environment, making it easy to recreate the environment elsewhere using:
```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After this, you can activate the python environment using
```bash
    conda activate apma-drp
```

Ensure that when you run python files, you are doing so using the python specified in the Miniconda container, the file path may be a bit hard to find.
